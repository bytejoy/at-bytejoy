# Tools

## Video Conference

We currently use [MeetSpace](http://www.meetspaceapp.com/) for video conference. We also recommend [shush](http://mizage.com/shush/).

## Screen Share

We use multiple tools depending on the purpose. We use [ScreenHero]() for pair programming or sessions where people need to share control of the screen. For company meetings, demos, or presentations we use [MeetSpace](http://www.meetspaceapp.com/).

## Screen Recording

We love [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and use it all the time to send little screencast demos of new features or how-tos. It's amazing and can natively export GIFs which has entirely replaced our use of [GIF Brewery 3](http://gifbrewery.com/).

## Workflow and Process

We use Trello to keep track of our projects. We generally spin up a new Trello board for each new project. We also have general boards for onboarding, team coordination, etc. You should have received invites to the appropriate boards.

Most people run Trello as a macOS application using [trello-macos-install](https://github.com/bytejoyhq/trello-macos-install).

## CI

We use [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) for all Docker based CI and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for Windows-specific projects. You'll find credentials in your welcome package.

## Email

We use [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/) for email, documents, and more. You'll find credentials in your welcome package.

## Chat

We use [Slack](https://bytejoy.slack.com). You can sign up using your `@bytejoy.com` email address.

## File Share

We use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) for file sharing. You have 1TB personal storage and access to the appropriate shared folders as described in your welcome package.

## Password Management

We actively enforce the use of [1Password Teams](https://1password.com/teams/) to manage and even share credentials. **Please don't post passwords in chat or email.** :neckbeard:

## Hardware, O/S, and Development Environment

Of course you're free to use whatever setup you find most productive but here are some of the most popular setups at ByteJoy.

### Hardware

By far the most popular machine is the [MacBookPro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). That is followed closely by the [Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx).

### Operating System

Of course this depends heavily on the hardware you've chosen but here is the most used at ByteJoy.

Number one is [macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos) followed by [kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/), [archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) in that order.

### Dev Tools

The list of dev tools changes rapidly but here are the most commonly used tools.

**Terminals**

The most common configuration is [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [tmate](https://tmate.io/).

**Editors**

Most popular is [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/) with [Alchemist](http://www.alchemist-elixir.org/) followed by [atom](http://atom.io) with [atom-elixir](https://github.com/msaraiva/atom-elixir).

We actively avoid Xamarin and prefer to work natively when possible. To that end we provide platform-specific tools such as Visual Studio, XCode, Android Studio, etc. You can find information about obtaining a license in your welcome package.

### Design Tools

[invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Principle](http://principleformac.com/), and [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) for prototypes. [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) for graphics work.

# Work Stuff

## Insurance, 401(k), PTO, Team Directory, FSA, HSA, and more!

We use [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com) to manage our HR-related stuff. You can download their mobile app to get started. You'll find credentials in your welcome package.
