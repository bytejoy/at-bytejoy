How we do it *at ByteJoy*.

Welcome, this will help you get up to speed and productive quickly. It is a living work-in-progress and aims to help you get familiar with the tools, workflow, process, and life at ByteJoy.

# Tools

## Video Conference

We currently use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for video conferences, company meetings, demos, and presentations.

## Screen Share

We use multiple tools depending on the purpose. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for pair programming or sessions where people need to share control of the screen. We also recommend [VS Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) for Visual Studio or VSCode. Honorable mention to [Meet](https://meet.google.com) by Google.

## Screen Recording

We love [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and use it all the time to send little screencast demos of new features or how-tos. It's amazing and can natively export GIFs which has entirely replaced our use of [GIF Brewery 3](http://gifbrewery.com/).

## Workflow and Process

#### Update: We're working on our own project management tool. Check with [@anna](https://github.com/annaminton) for details on how to get setup in the beta.

We use [Asana](https://asana.com) to keep track of our projects. We have projects for onboarding, team coordination, etc. You should have received invites to the appropriate projects.

Most people run Trello as a macOS application using [trello-macos-install](https://github.com/bytejoyhq/trello-macos-install).

## CI

We use [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) for all Docker based CI/CD and [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) for Windows-specific projects. You'll find credentials in your welcome package.

## Email

We use [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/) for email, documents, and more. You'll find credentials in your welcome package.

## Chat

We use [Slack](https://bytejoy.slack.com). You can sign up using your `@bytejoy.com` email address.

## File Share

We use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) for file sharing. You have 1TB personal storage and access to the appropriate shared folders as described in your welcome package.

## Password Management

We actively enforce the use of [1Password Teams](https://1password.com/teams/) to manage and even share credentials. **Please don't post passwords in chat or email.** :neckbeard:

## Hardware, O/S, and Development Environment

Of course you're free to use whatever setup you find most productive but here are some of the most popular setups at ByteJoy.

### Hardware

By far the most popular machine is the [MacBookPro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). That is followed closely by the [Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx).

### Operating System

Of course this depends heavily on the hardware you've chosen but here is the most used at ByteJoy.

Number one is [macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos) followed by [archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop).

### Dev Tools

The list of dev tools changes rapidly but here are the most commonly used tools.

**Terminals**

Mostly [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) but some diehard [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) fans.

**Editors**

Most popular is [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/) with [Alchemist](http://www.alchemist-elixir.org/) followed by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [vscode-elixir](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmcloug.vscode-elixir).

We actively avoid Xamarin and prefer to work natively when possible. To that end we provide platform-specific tools such as Visual Studio, XCode, Android Studio, etc. You can find information about obtaining a license in your welcome package.

### Design Tools

[invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Principle](http://principleformac.com/), and [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) for prototypes. [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) for graphics work.

# Work Stuff

## Insurance, 401(k), PTO, Team Directory, FSA, HSA, and more!

We use ~[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com)~ [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) to manage our HR-related stuff. You'll find a login link in your welcome package.
